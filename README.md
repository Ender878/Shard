![Shard_png2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b6138d2-c1b5-407c-aaca-fd7eff1a97fd)

**Shard** is an open source **ESP32 S3** board, the first one I ever designed!

## Core features:

- 16 MB Flash storage
- 8 MB RAM
- WiFi and Bluethoot capabilities
- Built-in Neopixel RGB LED
- 21 configurable GPIO pins
- Up to 16V for external Power supply
- UART

The board itself is pretty small, 4.6x4.8cm and doesn't have mounting holes unfortunately. It is designed to be an all-feature development board for prototyping.

>[!WARNING]
>The board hasn't been tested yet, as it is in production, and it could be malfunctional. I will update this page if there are any issues.
